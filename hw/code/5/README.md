In this simulation, in the first part, a random experiment is performed to determine the approximate maximum and minimum energies of Osyczka2 model. In the final experiment, a bigger interval [b_min, b_max] is used where b_min < experimental minimum energy, and b_max > experimental maximum energy.

For the printout, 
1. '!' is used only when the solution is better in retries. 
2. Local improvements are shown using '+' 
3. Local deterioration are shown using '?'. 
4. The first column is number of simulations.
5. The second column is normalized energy
6. Higher the normalized energy, the better the solution
