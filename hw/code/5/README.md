In this simulation, in the first part, a random experiment is performed to determine the approximate maximum and minimum energies of Osyczka2 model. In the final experiment, a bigger interval [b_min, b_max] is used where b_min < experimental minimum energy, and b_max > experimental maximum energy.

For the printout, '!' is used only when the solution is better in retries. Local improvements are shown using '+' and local deterioration are shown using '?'.

The output of the MaxWalkSat algorithm is as follows
